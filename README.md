# Coil Spring Inductance

This repository contains the data, processing and presentation for 'Force Sensing for Compliant Actuators Using Coil Spring Inductance' by Joost van der Weijde, Erik Vlasblom, Peter Dobbe, Heike Vallery and Michael Fritschi. This paper is published at IROS 2015.

By running 'run_data_processing_inductance_paper.m' all data is processed and styled such that it could directly be used in the paper. The code is written using MATLAB 2014b. The code includes short comments on its functionality.
